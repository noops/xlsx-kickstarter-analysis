# An analysis of media based Kickstarter campaigns 




Used basic excel functions to filter data, create pivot tables, and pivot charts for deeper analysis of kickstarter campaigns based on media. We can see in the outcomes based on launch date that there are more kickstarter campaigns launched in the summer months. According to the line graph beginning a kickstarter campaign in January, April, or August gives the campaign a higher chance to succeed than other months. Switching over to the outcomes based on goals sheet gives us a clearer picture of the data. Kickstarter campaigns with a goal of less than $5,000 have over a 70% chance of being successful. Once the goal exceeds $5,000 the number of kickstarter campaigns decreases sharply. More data would need to be analyzed to paint a clearer picture of the high dollar goal campaigns. A barchart or histogram would be a better way to present this data for both outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date. The line graph is not easy to interpret in my opinion, especially outcomes based on goals. Outcomes based on goals is the better way to analyze kickstarter campaigns. 

## Take Away Conclusions
1. Best launch months are January, April, or August
2. More kickstarter campaigns are launched in the summer months
3. Campaigns with a goal of less than $5,000 have over a 70% chance of success
